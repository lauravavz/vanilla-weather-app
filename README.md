# vanilla-weather-app

This is my second project created while attending the SheCodes Front-End Developement course.

This app integrate HTML5, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

The layout fot this application is inspired by the Google Weather app. 

The API used to forecast the weather is from https://openweathermap.org/.
